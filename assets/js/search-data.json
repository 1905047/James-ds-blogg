            "content": "My Lists and Dictionaries! . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . # variable of type string name = &quot;James Armstrong&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 16 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 86.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[0]&quot;, langs[0], type(langs[0])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: 16, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . name James Armstrong &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 16 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 86.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[0] Python &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;James Armstrong&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 16, &#39;score&#39;: 86.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] James Armstrong &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . My List and Dictionary purpose! . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;James&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Armstrong&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;March 28&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jamesa05047@stu.powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Favorite_Movies&quot;: [&quot;American Phsyco&quot;, &quot;God Father&quot;, &quot;IT&quot;, &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;The Hangover&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Matthew&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Salas&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;March 30&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;matthews032814@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Favorite_Movies&quot;: [&quot;Human Centapide&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formating With Loop Command! . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . Calling a function repeatedly! . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook.
